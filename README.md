# Coherent-Diffraction-Imaging
**General physical background**:

Our investigation primarily focused on the Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) experiment in Diamonds I-13 branchline. CDI is a lensless tomographic technique that measures the diffraction pattern of x-rays that have scattered off of a nanoscaled sample (e.g.nanotube). From this diffraction pattern it is possible to reconstruct a highly resolved image of the sample and thus is a widely used technique in both material and biomedical sciences.


The two phase retrieval algorithms presented here are Error Reduction and Gerchberg–Saxton algorithms. I have focused mainly on evaluating the equipment performance of the I-13-1 branchline’s coherent diffraction imaging experiment from Diamond Light Source using the Error Reduction algorithm.
